## Project Snapshot

An established electrical contractor in Adelaide was getting decent traffic to their website (around 800 visitors/month) but only converting 1.8% into leads. They had invested heavily in SEO and Google Ads but weren't seeing the bookings they needed to justify the investment.

## The Challenge

**Low conversion rate:** Only 14-15 leads per month from 800+ visitors
**Poor mobile experience:** 70% of traffic was mobile but the site wasn't optimized
**Confusing navigation:** Visitors couldn't quickly find what they needed
**Weak calls-to-action:** CTAs were buried and didn't stand out
**No trust signals:** Missing reviews, certifications, guarantees

## Our Strategy

We implemented a systematic conversion rate optimization approach:

**1. User Research**
- Conducted heatmap analysis to see where users dropped off
- Analyzed user recordings to identify friction points
- Surveyed existing customers about their decision process

**2. Landing Page Redesign**
- Created separate landing pages for residential vs. commercial services
- Improved mobile experience with larger buttons and simplified forms
- Added prominent trust signals (licenses, reviews, guarantees)
- Implemented clear value propositions above the fold

**3. A/B Testing Program**
- Tested 5 different headlines
- Compared form lengths (3 fields vs. 7 fields)
- Tested different CTA button colors and copy
- Experimented with social proof placement

## Execution Timeline

**Month 1:** Research and analysis phase. Set up testing infrastructure.

**Month 2:** Launched first variation of new landing page. Initial testing showed promising results.

**Month 3:** Rolled out winning variations. Continued testing secondary elements.

## Results

After 3 months of systematic optimization:

- **Conversion rate increased from 1.8% to 3.8%** (+112%)
- **Monthly leads grew from 14 to 30** (+114%)
- **Bounce rate decreased from 58% to 34%** (-41%)
- **Average time on page increased by 68%**
- **Mobile conversion rate improved from 1.2% to 3.1%**

The business could finally justify their digital marketing spend and started scaling their campaigns.
