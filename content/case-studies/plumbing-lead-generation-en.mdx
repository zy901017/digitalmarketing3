## Project Snapshot

A local plumbing business in Adelaide's northern suburbs had been running Google Ads for 8 months but wasn't seeing the return they needed. Despite spending $2,500/month on ads, they were only getting 15-20 leads per month, and many weren't qualified. They needed a complete overhaul of their digital marketing strategy.

## The Challenge

The plumbing business faced several key challenges:

- **High cost per lead:** Averaging $125-150 per lead, which was unsustainable
- **Poor ad targeting:** Ads were showing for irrelevant searches, wasting budget
- **No conversion tracking:** They couldn't tell which ads were actually bringing in phone calls
- **Generic landing page:** Their website wasn't optimized for conversions
- **Limited geographic targeting:** Ads were showing across all of Adelaide when they only serviced specific suburbs

## Our Strategy

We developed a comprehensive 3-month strategy focused on qualified lead generation:

**1. Campaign Restructuring**
- Created separate campaigns for emergency vs. scheduled services
- Implemented tight geographic targeting (15km radius)
- Added negative keywords to eliminate irrelevant searches
- Set up call extensions and location extensions

**2. Landing Page Optimization**
- Built a dedicated landing page for Google Ads traffic
- Added clear call-to-action buttons
- Included trust signals (license numbers, reviews, guarantees)
- Mobile-optimized with click-to-call functionality

**3. Conversion Tracking Setup**
- Implemented GA4 with proper conversion tracking
- Set up call tracking to measure phone lead quality
- Created custom dashboards for daily monitoring

## Execution Timeline

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Conducted comprehensive audit of existing campaigns
- Set up conversion tracking and call tracking
- Launched new landing page
- Restructured campaigns with better targeting

**Month 2: Optimization**
- Analyzed first month's data
- Adjusted bids based on performance
- Added more negative keywords
- Expanded high-performing ad groups

**Month 3: Scaling**
- Increased budget for top-performing campaigns
- Launched remarketing campaigns
- Tested new ad copy variations
- Fine-tuned geographic targeting

## Results

After 3 months of optimization:

- **Monthly leads increased from 17 to 28** (+67%)
- **Cost per lead dropped from $147 to $100** (-32%)
- **Landing page conversion rate improved from 2.1% to 3.2%** (+52%)
- **84% of leads were qualified** (vs. 61% previously)
- **ROI increased to 4.2:1** (up from 1.8:1)

The business owner was able to hire an additional plumber to handle the increased workload.
